Although the Palestinian bee is considered a distinct species by naturalists, it appears to belong to the subspecies of the common bee, Apis mellifica. It is blonder and more clearly marked than the British bee. It's also smaller, and much more dangerous. As honey is an important food item in the East, it is the carefully cultivated bee; it consists of the hive of a clay tube, somewhat of a water pipe, or a number of them placed on top of each other. These pipes are about 20 cm in diameter and 1 meter long with their ends closed, with only a small opening. It is, however, a singular fact that the only honey mentioned in the Bible is wild honey; Even today, many Arabs live off the work of harvesting it. Not surprisingly, Samson found honey in the lion's carcass he had killed. The flesh of the animal certainly did not take long to be devoured by the beasts; and the bees could then find a place of their own, made up of dry ribs, where to fill their honeycombs with sweet honey, and to gather them in the abundance of flowers, which grew by them. The curious expression in Is 7.18, the Lord will whistle ... to the bees that walk in the land of Assyria, is an allusion to the practice of calling the bees out of their hives by the shrill whistling sound.

{"palavra":" Bless ","texto":" When Moses blessed the children of Israel (Deut 33), he prophesied a continual progression of prosperity for them in God's help. This was a patriarchal form of blessing and at the same time a religious ceremony, in keeping with the heavenly Father's way of blessing, which is always, in reality, bestowing benefits upon His creatures. When it is said in Ps 103 that men bless the Lord, this means to belong to the Creator the praise and honor that is equally the duty and joy of His creatures to render to Him. But when it is God who blesses His people, as in Genesis 1:22 and Ephesians 1: 3, it means that He bestows upon His children every kind of temporal and spiritual benefit, and in this way communicates to them some part of that infinite good. -aventitude that exists in Him (1 Tim. 1:11). Blessing was a custom that was often observed among the Hebrews, and is often mentioned in the Holy Scriptures. So Jacob blessed his sons (Gen 49), and Moses the sons of Israel (Deut 33). Abraham was blessed by Melchizedek. So important was the act of blessing in the religion and life of the Jews that the very method of their granting was part of the Israelite ritual (Num. 6:23). The blessing was given standing with hands raised to heaven. (* see Blessing.)"},

Its bitterness gives rise to numerous figurative passages of Scripture. Wormwood and gall are figures of a life embittered by grief, remorse, and punitive suffering. Under this figure are the Israelites warned by Moses against idolatry (Deut 29:18). In similar terms Solomon warns the youth against evil inclinations (Prov. 5.4). Jeremiah twice uses the word as expressive of the punishment that would fall on idolatrous and corrupt Israel (Jer. 9: 15-28: 16). And later he laments the fulfillment of the prophecy, contemplating the desolation that followed the seizure of Jerusalem (Lam. 8:15, 19). The mystical star of the apocalyptic vision, which was called Wormwood, describes itself as falling into the waters of the earth, making them mortally bitter (Rev. 8:11).

Ahab's reign was distinguished by the action of the prophet Elijah, who strongly opposed Jezebel, when she introduced into Israel the worship of Baal and Astaroth (* see Elijah). Queen Jezebel not only led her husband into idolatry, but also led him to live an evil life. It was she who instigated Ahab to commit a great crime against Naboth, whose vineyard the king sought to join with other pleasant plots that were part of his new palace of Jezreel. Naboth refused to sell the land, based on the law of Moses, according to which the vineyard was the inheritance of his parents. By his statement he was accused of blasphemy, and he and his sons were stoned to death (2 Kings 9:26). Elijah then said that the destruction of Ahab's house would be the consequence of this atrocity. Much of Ahab's reign was occupied with three campaigns against Ben-hadad ii, king of Damascus. From the first two wars he came out completely victorious. At the end of the second, King Ben-hadad fell into Ahab's hands, but was released on the condition that he restore all the cities of Israel he had in his possession and make bazaars for Ahab in Damascus (1 Kings 20:84). God's blessing was taken from the third campaign. the prophet Micaiah (or Micah) warned Ahab that he would not now have divine protection, saying that the prophets who had counseled him were hastening their ruin. Ahab went into battle and disguised himself from being known by the Ben-Hadad archers.

Growing mainly in the Sinai peninsula, it also appears in Palestine, being found in the Jordan Valley and the eastern part of the Dead Sea. It has a hard and thorny stem, and produces yellow flowers among its peniform foliage. Its pod is like that of the laburnum. The wood is sturdy, durable, and admirably adapted to joiner's works (Ex 25, 26, 27, 30, 35, 36, 37, 38 - Deut 10.3)."},

However, we must not suppose that the camps of the Israelites were formed under strict military regulation. There was no such thing as entrenchment, or other means, to ward off any attack from enemies. There were, however, for hygienic purposes, strict orders that had to be fulfilled (Num. 5: 3 - Deuteronomy 23:14). The form of camping is prescribed in Num. 2: 3. The whole body of the Israelite people constituted four divisions - each division was made up of three tribes, so that the tabernacle was enclosed in a square. Each of the divisions had a banner (Num. 1.52 and 2.2), as did each tribe - and their large insignia of their families, making up one tribe. The health laws for the camp were extraordinarily thorough and very strict. the dead were buried outside the camp (Lev. 10: 4) - and all those who had been in contact with the bodies had equally to be gone for the space of seven days (Num 31:19). lepers were strictly excluded from living with their fellow men (Lev. 13:46). There was also, outside the camp, a place where all filth and refuse were laid and burned (Lev. 4:12 - Deut. 23:10). ACAZ Possessor. 1.

However, the Allies took large numbers of captives (2 Chr 28), who were restored as a result of the rebukes of the prophet odede, and great damage also inflicted on Judah (2 Kgs 16), taking Elate, a flourishing spot of the Red Sea, in which after the expulsion of the Jews, the Syrians were restored. Ahaz, in the midst of these troubles, sought help from Tiglath-Pileser, who invaded Syria, seized Damascus, killed Rezin, and deprived Israel of its northern and overseas territories. Ahaz, in return for these services, became tributary to Tiglath-pileser, sent him all the treasures of the temple and his own palace, and even appeared before him in Damascus as his vassal - when he died after a reign of sixteen years old, they did not put him in the tombs of kings (2 Chr 28:27) 2.

The union between uncle and nephew was so close that there was a great danger that gentilism would spread with great force through the kingdoms of the Hebrews. This evil was averted by a great revolution, moved in Israel by Jehu, under the direction of Elisha. When Ahaziah was visiting his uncle in Jezreel, Jehu approached the city. The two kings went out to meet him, but Jehu's arrow pierced Joram's heart, and Ahaziah was persecuted and mortally wounded. He had reigned only one year (2 Kings 8: 25-29, and 9)."},

Divination was generally part of the predicates of a priestly caste, which made use of it for its own ends (Gen. 41: 8-47 47: 13 - Jer. 5:31 - Dan. 2: 2). Those who claimed to have familiar spirits in them (Isa. 8:19, 29: 4) are believed to be ventriloquists, who from below the ground, chirping through their teeth, murmured to imitate the voice of spirits believed to have been invoked from the dead. Concerning the invocation of the soul of Samuel by the pythoness of En-Dor (1 Sam 28: 7-25), considering that the woman was undoubtedly an impostor, we can say that God allowed on this occasion, for His own purposes, that Saul, by the ingenious the witch's practices, could be fully warned of what awaited him, still having time in his last days to turn his heart to God. In Ezek 21:21 the reference to divination is by arrow. The king threw a bundle of arrows to see which direction they were going down - and as they fell at his right hand, he marched to Jerusalem. The cup by which Joseph is said to have guessed (Gen. 44: 5) was a silver vase (symbolic of the Nile, the cup of Egypt) that was supposed to have mysterious magical qualities. Divination was made by radiating water, or by gems, with magical inscriptions thrown at it. The animal's liver condition, which had been sacrificed, was thought by some to be an indication of the future (Ezek 21:21). Moses forbade all manner of divination. (* see Magic.)"},

The custom of adoption has been followed by all nations and at all times. Civil adoption was permitted and determined for the relief and comfort of those who had no children - but in spiritual adoption this reason does not appear. the omnipotent Lord adopts believers, and they become children of God, not because there is any excellence in them, but because He is infinitely good. Pharaoh's daughter adopted Moses because of her beautiful face (Acts 7: 20,21) - Mordecai adopted Esther for the same reason, and because she was his kinswoman (Et 2: 7) - there is nothing in man, however, that makes him worthy of adoption divine (Eze 16.5).

The rebuilding of the temple began with great zeal, but because of opposition from the Samaritans, works were suspended in space. fourteen years old. Then Darius Histaspes came up to the throne of Babylon, and God-inspired Haggai urged Zerubbabel and Joshua to resume the work of the temple. their reasonings produce an effect (Ag 1: 14-2: 1), while the Jews continued rebuilding in the year 520, sixteen years after the return from captivity.

Twenty-four days after this prophecy, the works were continued, the Israelites being animated by a merciful message from God. But after a month, the zeal of the people again cooled, and they began to wonder if restoration was possible. In order to remove the doubts of the people and raise their weakened energies, Haggai appeared declaring that the Lord was with them and prophesying that the glory of the new temple should be greater than that of the first (Hag 2: 1-9). For the third time Haggai addresses the Jews and blames them for their indifference - at the same time urging them to work as hard as possible (Hag. 2:10 to 19). On the same day another prophecy was uttered, addressed to Zerubbabel, prince of Judah, representative of the house of David, and the one through whom the Messiah's genealogy begins after the captivity, ending the prophetic words with the promise that God's people would be preserved in the fall and ruin of the kingdoms of the earth (2: 20-23).

{"palavra":" Agnosticism ","texto":" The term \"agnosticism\" comes from the Greek \"agnostic\", which means \"unknowable\". The word is of more or less recent origin. It is first known and used in the modern and familiar sense by Thomas Huxley (1825-1895) in 1869, as he himself recounts in his 1889 writing \"Agnosticism\" and inserted in the \"Collected Essays\". In opposition to \"gnosis,\" Huxley understood that word to \"know nothing\" about an argument or to find itself facing an insoluble problem. Of course, it was the favorable philosophical environment of the time, with Hume's skepticism and Kant's critical philosophy, that allowed Huxley to coin and disseminate the term \"agnosticism\" as an expression of a certain thought. Huxley chose him to present himself with an \"ism\" as well, and to classify his thinking with his colleagues at the Metaphysical Society of London, as the fashion of the \"isms\" of the day demanded. The new word has successively assumed and retained a narrower and more precise meaning, indicating a position of \"not knowing\" of metaphysical truth or \"not knowing\" of the existence of a supernatural reality, so-called \"unknowable\". Already the Athenians of the time of St. Paul the Apostle addressed an unknown God (agnosto Theó) raising his altars and praying to him. Therefore, \"agnosticism\" generally means the spiritual attitude of one who suspends his own judgment about the existence and nature of the Absolute and the Godhead. It declares the unattainability on the part of the human mind of problems concerning the first origin of reality, the nature of God, and the last destiny of man. It is not to be confused with skepticism, for it is more an abstraction than a negation of knowledge: agnosticism invites a position of neutrality between affirmation and negation about everything that concerns the problems of the Absolute."},

The first rains fall in October. These are not continuous but intermittent rains, giving the farmer the opportunity to sow wheat and barley. Rain continues to fall at intervals during November and December, with rainy days still in March and April. In the remaining months until October, the weather is dry and the sky is cloudless. As soon as in October the ground is softened by the rains, the sowing of wheat, barley and lentils begins. the plow of the ancient Hebrews was probably similar to today, consisting of a thick rod made of two pieces, to which was attached a crossbar to which was attached a joint of oxen. At the other end was a piece at an obtuse angle, which ended underneath the muzzle and there was a rough scrawl at the top. the oxen were propelled by a stinging rod, which was also used to break the clods of earth or to clean the plow. The harvest begins in late March or early April. Barley comes first, with wheat last in mid-May. harvest time lasted seven weeks. the wheat was mowed with a scythe and gathered in bundles and carried to the threshing floor, a circular, windswept ground about twenty meters in diameter. Here was the grain released from the straw by the riding of oxen or asses upon the wheat. Portions of wheat were also sometimes threshed by means of a flail (Isa. 28.27) - but more often, however, an instrument was used, which consisted of a wooden frame with pointed stones in holes at the bottom, in contact with the wheat. This frame was pulled by oxen, and often the farmer would sit up to increase the weight. Also used for threshing was a wooden casing adapted to the wheels of a car, with a number of blades for cutting wheat. Then, when the wind was lightly blowing, the straw with the grain rose up with wooden shovels, and it fell to the threshing floor and carried it out into the air. the wheat was still clean of stones and impurities stirred in a winnowing (Am 9.9). The longest straw served as food for the oxen (Isa 11: 7), with no value remaining. The crop was stored underground (Jr 41.8). In exchange for gold and silver and luxury goods, it supplied Palestine with the contents of its warehouses, the Tire and Sidon markets, where the goods of all nations from Spain to India were also gathered."},

From Abraham, faith (15: 6) and obedience (17: 1: 9: 22: 16) were manifested. As set forth in this covenant, the narration of the Exodus begins, assuming that God remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Ex. 2:24). The promulgation of the Law on Mount Sinai was prepared with the reminder that God delivered Israel, and with the promises of other blessings on condition of obedience. Moses wrote all the words of the Lord in the Book of Covenant, and after the atoning sacrifices read it before the people, who answered, \"Whatever the Lord has spoken, we will do and obey - and after this he sprinkled the people with the blood of God.\" covenant (Ex 19.4 to 6 and 24.4 to 8). It is to this covenant that references are generally made throughout the OT, and in remarkable NT statements. The tablets of the Law were later placed on the Ark of the Covenant, which was regarded as the symbol of the LORD, and the place of His manifestation. 25.21, etc.). And just as eating the salt of every man meant a pledge of friendship, so the salt of the covenant should be added to every meal offering, as a holy reminder of the sacred ties between God and His chosen people (Lev. 2:13 - * see Num. 18.19 - 2 Cr 13.5). the covenant of a perpetual royalty in the seed of David (2 Sam. 23: 5) is recorded in 2 Sam. 7.

This ban was later not respected. Solomon made alliances with Hiram king of Tire and Pharaoh king of Egypt. The king of Israel envisioned, through his covenant with Hiram, to obtain materials and laborers for the building of the temple, as well as shipbuilders and sailors. The alliance with the king of Egypt gave Solomon a monopoly on that country's horse business and other products. Disagreements between Judah and Israel, and their relations with Egypt and the Assyrian and Babylonian monarchies, led those peoples to numerous alliances and counter-alliances. See the books of Kings and Chronicles, as well as passages from Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah. Various religious rites were performed when an alliance was made. The victim of the sacrifice was killed and divided into two parts, among which the interested persons passed, asking at that time the curse of such a shattering to the one who broke the terms of the covenant. This custom has been in place for a long time (Jer. 34:18). Generally speaking, the oath is mentioned only in covenanting, either between nations (Josh 9.15), or between individuals (Gen. 26.28 - 31.53 - 2 Kgs 11.4). the event was celebrated with a feast (Ex 24: 11- 2 Sam 3.12 to 20). salt, as a symbol of faithfulness, was used on these occasions, applied to sacrifices - and from this use comes the expression covenant of salt (Num. 18: 19-2 Chronicles 13: 5). A column arose in memory of the covenant between Laban and Jacob (Gen. 31.52). Gifts were also sent by the party requesting the covenant (1 Kgs 15.18 - is 30.6). Jews have always attached great importance to being faithful to their commitments (Josh 9:18). Divine wrath fell on those who violated them (2 Sam 21.1 - Eze 17.16)."},

Peter's vision, before the reception of Gentile converts, fits in with this view (Acts 10:12). The law on delicacies applied to all people, and not, as was the case in other countries where there were similar restrictions, one class or certain classes only.

It may be, however, that many restrictions were made to avoid eating anything that the pagans considered sacred.

The first instructions regarding the raising of an altar in connection with the Law are found in Exodus 20:24, 25. It must be of earth, or of rough stone, and without steps. There were two altars in relation to the tabernacle, one in the outer court, and one in the Holy Place. The first was called the altar of brass, or the burnt offering, and it was in front of the tabernacle. It was concave in shape, made of acacia wood, square, its length and its width seven cubits, and its height three cubits - it was covered with metal, and was provided with rings and staves for the purpose of being carried in journeys of the Israelite people through the desert. At each of its four corners was a ledge, which was called the end. There was no step but an edge around for the convenience of the priests while they were doing their work. Because sacrifices were offered on this altar, their situation at the entrance of the tabernacle was a significant lesson for the people of Israel that there was no possible approach to God except through sacrifice (Ex 27: 1-8 - 38: 1). the altar of incense was in the holy place, right in front of the veil, which was before the holy of holies. It was square, its length and breadth a cubit, two cubits high: it was made of acacia wood, and was overlaid with pure gold; Although this altar was placed in the Holy Place, it had such a relation to the spiritual meaning of the Holy of Holies, that it could be said to belong to this place (Heb 9 :3,4).

Moses, having the weight of the administration of justice upon him, on the advice of Jethro, his father-in-law, appointed magistrates of varying degrees of authority, delegating to them the resolution of business, except the most serious ones (Ex 18: 13-26): by v. 12 Clearly these were chosen from among the elders of Israel.

Little is said about this. angels usually appear in the figure of men (Gen. 18 - Ac 1:10), and sometimes clothed with glory (Dan. 10: 5,6 and Luke 24: 4). the seraphim of Isaiah (6: 2), and the cherubim of Ezekiel (1: 6), have wings: so also Gabriel (Dan. 9:21), and the angel of Revelation (14: 6). In Heb 1:14 they are ministering spirits (cp. With Mark 12:25). 2. Your duties. They were primitively God's messengers to lead men in His name, to guide them, to guard them, to strengthen them, to warn them, to reproach them, and to punish them. * see the accounts of Gen 18,19,22,28,32 - Jz 2,6,13 - 2 Sm 24,16,17 - 2 Rs 19.35: and cp. with Sl 34.7, 35.5.6 and 91.11. In the earliest references the angel of the Lord is not quite distinct from the Lord Himself. It is He who speaks (Gen. 22.16 - Ex. 3.2 to 16 - Judg 13.18 to 22). There is also the idea of ​​a great multitude of angels (Gen. 28: 12-32: 2), who in later thought are represented as the army of God, His court and counsel (Ps. 103: 20,21 - 89: 7, is 6.2 to 5, etc. - cp with Lc 2.13 - Mt 26.53 - Lc 12.8,9 - Hb 12.22 - Rev 5.11, etc.). They are guards, not only of individuals but of nations (Ex 23:20 - Dan 10: 13-20): every Christian church has its angel, representing God's presence and the power of God in the church - it is divine guarantee of the vitality and effectiveness of the Church. church (* see Rev 2.1 to 8). An expression of Jesus Christ seems to support the belief that each person has his guardian angel in heaven, and that the care of children is the responsibility of the highest beings among God's ministers (Matt. 18:10 - cp. With Luke 1:19). ). According to all this, the angels serve Jesus (Mark 1:13 - Luke 22:43), express an interest in decorum in church meetings (1 Cor. 11:10), and for the salvation of men (Luke 16: 10 - 1 Pet. 1:12). in the great revelation of Sinai (Acts 53 - Gal. 3:19 - Heb. 2: 2), and will execute the Last Judgment (Matt. 13:41). They are of different order. Two are especially mentioned: Michael, one of the chief angelic princes (Dan. 10:13), the archangel (Dan. 9), and Gabriel (Dan. 8:16 - Luke 1:19). In the apocryphal books other names appear, especially Raphael and Uriel. There are also references to these heavenly beings in Eph. 1:21 - Col 1:16 - 2.16 - and in the epistle to the Colossians the idea of ​​interposing them between God and man is especially condemned, thus depriving Jesus of the honor of the sole Mediator. , which belongs to him (Col 1:14 to 20, 2.18, etc.).

The basis of NT teaching can be found in the words of Jesus, mentioned in Mt 24: 6-24. Paul refers to this latter gathering of forces opposed to the spirit of the Gospel as deviation from the truth (apostasy), and personifies them. in the man of iniquity, in the son of perdition (2 Thess. 2: 2-3-12).

{"palavra":" antioco ","texto":" The name of Antiochus is not found in Scripture, but there are several references to the monarchs of this designation. Antiochus ii is one of the kings referred to in Daniel 11: 6 But after years they will be allied with one another. He was king of Syria, and had been at war with the king of Egypt (Ptolemy Philadelfo). Peace was made in the year 250 BC. Ptolemy, the king of the South, gave his daughter Bernice to Antiochus, the king of the north, who separated from his first wife Laudice. When Ptolemy died (247 BC), Laudice and his sons were again called to court. And Bernice could not retain her power, for Laudice poisoned Antiochus, who had sustained that rival of hers, and had her and her son killed (Dan. 11: 6). After the death of Antiochus, Ptolemy Emergetes, Berenice's brother (a shoot of her lineage) sought revenge for the death of this sister of his, invading Syria: in this invasion Laudice was killed, and her son expelled from the throne for some time, the whole country being plundered (Dan. 11: 7 to 9). Hostilities continued for many years, and a grandson of Antiochus threatened to overthrow the power of Egypt (Dan. 11: 9-10). Antiochus iii, king of Syria, nicknamed the Great, was grandson of Antiochus ii. He teamed with Philip III of Macedonia to conquer and divide the Egyptian dominions. Some factions of the Jews embraced the same cause (Dan. 11:14). However, Antiochus and Philip were forced, because of disturbances in their countries, to give up their company, resulting in the seizing of Jerusalem the King of Egypt and reclaiming the territory he had lost. In the year 198 BC, Antiochus reappeared in the field and imprisoned Scopas and his troops who had taken refuge in Sidon (Dan. 11:15). the Jews received Antiochus as their deliverer, and he remained in the glorious land, and all will be in his hands (Dan. 11:16). Later she gave Antiochus in marriage her daughter Cleopatra to Ptolemy Epiphanes, king of Egypt, and by her dowry the provinces of Phenicia - but she favored her husband's interests more than her father's. In 187 BC Antiochus attacked the temple of Belos in Elimais, being murdered by the people who rushed to defend his sanctuary. In this way he stumbled, fell, and was not found (Dan. 11:19). With respect to the Jews, Antiochus not only gave them complete freedom of worship, but also made rich donations to the temple, greatly favoring the priests. Appreciating the faithfulness of the Jews, he transported 2,000 Israeli families from Mesopotamia to Lydia and Phrygia to undo the revolutionary tendencies that had manifested in these provinces. Antiochus IV, Epiphanes, king of Syria, younger son of the preceding. Seleucus, the eldest son, was killed by Heliodorus, who usurped the crown. Antiochus expelled the latter, obtaining himself the kingdom with intrigue, excluding Demetrius, the son of Seleucus (Dan. 11:21). After this he promoted four happy campaigns against Egypt, avoiding the complete conquest of the country by the intervention of the Romans (Dan. 11:24). This king was wasteful in his expenses, and the conditions of Palestine during his reign were turbulent. When in his second campaign (170 BC) he returned from Egypt, assaulted Jerusalem, plundered the temple, ordering a terrible carnage."},
{"palavra":" antioquia ","texto":" There were two important cities with this name. (1) Antioch of Syria. No city after Jerusalem is as closely connected with the early history of Christianity as Syria's Antioch. Christians who had to leave Jerusalem after Stephen's death preached the Gospel in Antioch. It was in this place that Paul reproached Peter for conducting himself, contrary to what he ought to be, according to the reasons of the emissaries of Jerusalem (Gal. 2:11, 12). There the first Gentile church was founded (Acts 11:20, 21) - there, for the first time, the disciples of Jesus Christ were called Christians - there St. Paul practiced the systematic ministerial work - and from this place he set out to make his first journey. missionary, and returned. And after the Apostolic Council (whose resolutions were especially addressed to the converts among the Gentiles in Antioch, Acts 15:23), the Apostle began in this same city his second missionary journey, returning to the same place - and from here again departed, making the third trip, which ended with his arrest in Jerusalem and Caesarea. This famous city of Antioch was founded in 300 BC, and the Jews settled there early on in large numbers, and were governed by their own chief, allowing them to have the same political privileges as the Greeks. This is certainly the Antioch of the Roman period, which is the New Testament. citizens became notable for their rude handling of issues and the invention of nicknames. the name of Christians was perhaps derided as the disciples of the Divine Master. There was near Daphne, the famous shrine of Apollo. Modern Antakia is a miserable and small settlement. (2) Pisidian Antioch is mentioned in Acts 13 and 14, and in 2 Tim. 3:11. All that remains of this land are ruins, some of which are important, such as a temple, a theater, a church, and a beautiful aqueduct. Paul's preaching in the Antioch synagogue led to the conversion of a large number of Gentiles - and this fact so irritated the Jews that they opposed the Apostle so much that he was forced to leave for iconic and then Lystra. . Returning from Lystra, St. Paul again went to Antioch to confirm the converts in faith. These events took place on the occasion of the first missionary journey, with St. Barnabé going with St. Paul. The words of 2 Tim. 3:10, 11 show that Timothy was well informed of what the Apostle had suffered during his first visit to Pisidian Antioch."},

{"palavra":" apocalypse ","texto":" the book of revelation. This is called the last book of the Bible because it contains the prophetic doctrines revealed to the author by Jesus Christ. Its authorship is, by the book itself, attributed to John (1,1,4,9 - 22.8). It was the servant of Jesus Christ (1.1), who testified to the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ (1.2). The Early Church, in almost universal testimony, says that the author of Revelation is the Apostle John, son of Zebedee, who wrote the fourth Gospel. With respect to the DATE of the book, it is much discussed. The main question is whether John's exile from Patmos, a small island in the Aegean, came when Nero was emperor of Rome (AD 64-68) or in the time of Emperor Domitian (81-96). This book is of the same prophetic character, which distinguishes the books of Daniel and Ezekiel. The aim of this apocalyptic literature was always to encourage and encourage the Jewish people in times of national disgrace, with the certainty of a glorious future for the long-awaited victory of the Israeli Liberator. The content can be divided as follows: The first part (1 to 3) refers to the things that are, and comprises a preparatory view of divine perfections, the Redeemer's sympathy for men, and also the epistles to angels, which are personifications of the spirit of each of the seven churches. Each of these letters or epistles consists of three parts: (1) the introduction, which always refers to some of the attributes of the one who speaks to the church, taken from the preceding vision, and in which a progressive order and an adaptation to the general sense are observed. from the following epistle - (2) a description of the characteristics of the church with convenient animation, admonition, and censorship - (3) and the promises of a reward to those who overcome, promises that are made to all churches. The remaining part of the book (4 to 22) comprises the prophecy of what should happen after these things. There are a number of visions that show, through symbolic images and figurative language, the conflicts and sufferings of God's people, and the action of Providence upon the persecutors of the faithful. And he concludes by presenting the fall of the mystical Babylon, which is the figure of error, and showing the triumphant New Jerusalem, the perfected church. The whole matter of the book can also be divided into seven parts, apart from the prologue, which comprises the first eight verses of ch. 1st: l. The seven epistles to the seven churches (1 to 3) - 2. The seven seals (4.1 to 8.1) - 3. The seven resonant trumpets (8.2 to 11) - 4. The seven mystical figures: the sun-clad woman, the dragon red, the male child, the first beast that came out of the sea, the second beast that rose from the earth, the Lamb on Mount Zion, the Son of Man on the cloud - 5. the pouring out of the seven bowls (15,16) - 6. The Annihilation of the Enemies of the Church (17-20) - 7. The Glories of the Holy City, the New Jerusalem (21 to 22.5) - 7. Epilogue (22.6 to 21). Interpretation of prophecy has been the subject of much discussion. The different theories can be arranged in four paragraphs: (1) The preterist interpretation, which says that the prophecies of Revelation had their fulfillment in the early church age. critics of the preterist system claim that much of the book refers to the time of Nero's persecution and Jewish rebellion. the seven kings of which v. 10 of chap. 17 mean the emperors Augustus, Tiberius, Gaius Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba and oto. what is said in 13: 18 regarding the number of the beast 666 corresponds, according to this system of interpretation, to the numerical value of the Hebrew letters in the words Nero Cesar. g) The historical school of exhibitors considers these prophecies as a delineation of the great events of world history, or of the church, from apostolic times to the end of the world. (3) The futurist school holds that most or all of this series of prophecies concern events that will take place shortly before the second coming of Christ. the antichrist, or the apocalyptic beast is, according to this theory, an unfaithful in person, who will reign over the full extent of the old Roman empire, and will triumphantly persecute the saints through space for only three and a half years, after which Christ destroys that mighty wicked man. . (4) The fourth system of interpretation, called spiritual or ideal, considers Revelation a picturesque manifestation of great principles in constant conflict, though in various forms, and of an eclectic character. It is important to note the language correspondence, in certain expressions, between the Gospel of John and Revelation: i. The application of the title Word of God to Jesus (19:13)."},

These books, with the exception of 2 Ezra, Eleysian, Judith, Tobias, and 1 of the Maccabees, were first written in Greek, but their contents vary in different collections. Here are the apocryphal books in their usual order: i (or iii) from Ezra: It deals with historical facts from the time of Josiah to Ezra, most of the matter being taken from the books of the Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah. It was written perhaps in the first century. C. ii (or iV) of Eedrae: A series of especially apocalyptic visions and prophecies that Ezra announced. It is from the end of the 1st century AD Tobiar: A legendary narrative, interesting for the knowledge of the customs of the ancient days of Aicar.

It was written around the middle of the second century BC Esther: Chapters added to the canonical work. It is, perhaps, from the second century BC Solomon's Wisdom: A book written somewhat in the style of the book of Proverbs, being precious in establishing the contrast between true wisdom and paganism.

There is also the Third Book of Maccabees, which is, it seems, a fictional story of the year 217 a. C., dealing with the relations of the Egyptian king, Ptolemy IV, with the Jews of Palestine and Alexandria. DATE uncertain, but before 70d. C. There is also the Fourth Book of the Maccabees, which is a homiletical essay by a Jewish man of Alexandria who knows the Stoic school on the subject matter of the 2nd book of the Maccabees. It is perhaps from the 1st century d. C. Although the apocryphal books are included in the version of the Seventy, no certain quotation is made of them in the New Testament. True, the Fathers often quoted them in isolation, as if they were Holy Scripture, but in their argument they distinguished the apocryphal from the canonical books. St. Jerome, in particular, at the end of the 4th century, made a clear distinction between these books. To defend himself from limiting his Latin translation to the books of the Hebrew Canon, he said: Any book besides these must be counted among the apocrypha. Sto. But Augustine (354-430 AD), who did not know Hebrew, joined the apocrypha with the canonicals as to distinguish them from heretical books. unfortunately, this writer's ideas prevailed, and the apocryphal books remained in the official edition (the Vulgate) of the church of Rome. the Council of Trent, 1546, accepted all books ... with equal sentiment and reverence, and anathematized those who did not regard them alike."},

{"palavra":" apokálypsis ","texto":" The Greek preposition apó indicates a movement away or removed from something outside an object. So it is used in Mt 5:29: \"If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away from you (after I am).\" In Hebrew, the verb gâlâh is used to mean \"undress\", \"discover\", \"reveal\", \"unveil\". Exodus 20:26 says, \"Thou shalt not go up the step of my altar, that thy nakedness may not be discovered (thigâleh).\" And 1Sam 2,27: \"A man of God came to Eli and said unto him, Thus saith Yahweh. Behold, I am revealed (nighlêthî) to thy father's house ...\". 2:29 uses the verb gâlâh for the revelation of what must happen: \"While you were upon your bed, O king, thoughts were coming to you about what should happen in the future, and he who reveals (weghâlê) the mysteries to you. made known what should happen \". LXX translates the verb gâlâh by the Greek apokalýptô, which means \"to discover\", \"to reveal\", \"to unveil\", \"to remove the veil\". The NT uses the same verb in this sense. Mt 10.26, for example: \"Do not be afraid of them, therefore. For there is nothing covered that will not be discovered (apokalyfthêsetai).\" Or Luke 10:22: \"Everything has been given to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is but the Father, and who is the Father but the Son, and to whom the Son will reveal Him (apokalýpsai).\" From this verb derives the Greek feminine noun apokálypsis, \"revelation\", \"apocalypse\". In Gal 2: 2 Paul says about his visit to Jerusalem: \"I went up by reason of a revelation (apokálypsin) ...\". And the book of Revelation begins like this: \"Revelation (apokálypsis) of Jesus Christ ...\"."},

In the gospels. St. Luke tells us that the name apostles was given to the twelve by Jesus Christ (6:13), and in four more passages he uses it concerning the disciples (9:10, 17.5, 22.14, 24.10). In each of the other Gospels the term occurs only once (Mt 10.2 - Mk 6.30 - Jn 13:16). In Acts and Epistles, especially in the writings of St. Paul, it is frequent. The reason is clear: Jesus called some disciples to live closely with Him and learn the Word of the Gospel, but always to send them everywhere as His representatives. From this it follows that the essential ideas of the apostolate must be understood in all the Master's relations with the twelve, although the name belongs properly to cases in which the disciple goes on a mission at any point, whether to deal with temporal services during the life of Jesus. Christ wants to sustain the gospel work after His death. The idea comes expressed with true knowledge and phrase precision in St. Mark, when it is said that he called those whom he himself desired, and came to him. Then he appointed twelve to be with him and to send them to preach (Mk 3:13, 14). The meaning of the verb to send includes that of apostle (Greek apostello). The primary study of the meaning of the apostle on the basis of the Gospels must be done around these three points: call, education, mission. Suffice it to mention here some of the features of each specialty, as found in the simple and primitive narration of the Gospel of Mark (a) The Call. the first act of the public ministry of Jesus Christ is the calling of Simon and Andrew, James and John, to His company to make them fishers of men (Mk 1: 16-20). A strange authority is noted in the way of calling, and an immediate answer corresponds to it: these characteristics appear in the later call of Levi (2.14), and even in the naming of the twelve (3.13 to 19)."},

He was chosen by God to be co-worker with Moses by virtue of his gift of speech (Ex 4:16). He went with Moses to Pharaoh, performing signs in the presence of this king, and also being God's instrument in other wonderful cases (Ex 7:10). In the battle against Amalek, Aaron and Hur held the hands of Moses so that Israel might be victorious (Exodus 17:12). When Moses ascended Mount Sinai, Aaron was persuaded by the people to cast a golden calf for worship, and for his conduct was severely rebuked. Moses prayed, and obtained God's forgiveness for the people and Aaron (Deuteronomy 9:20). Some time later he was consecrated high priest, and this high office should be hereditary in the family. Korah and the Levites rebelled against their priestly dignity, the former being consumed by fire. Aaron offered incense to suspend the plague, and the Lord manifestly accepted his intercession for the people. Along with Moses and the princes of Israel he was given the task of counting the people. Aaron and Miriam's murmur against Moses was perhaps rooted in Miriam's ill will, but it did not persist long (Num. 12). In Meribah he and Moses sinned (Num. 20:10 ff.), And it seems that his death came shortly afterwards on Mount Hor, succeeding his son Eleazar, who, with Moses present alone, directed the cult of the grave ( Numbers 20.28). Aaron had of his wife Elisheba four sons.

But in the hands of seasoned warriors it could be handled with terrible effect (2 Sam. 20: 8-12 - 1 Kgs. 2.5). It was tucked into a sheath, and was strapped to a belt. Before the time of metal, blunt and cutting weapons were made of flint, but nowhere are the Israelites said to have used them. Only in wartime was the sword used - in peacetime even the king in his majesty brought it (1 Kings 3:24). 2. The spear, of various kinds, from the very strong weapon, the chanith, which weighed about 25 arratels, and was used by Goliath and Saul, to the light, short-armed kidon that the warrior carried on his back among the shoulders. There were still others, such as romack, slelach, and shebet. It was with the shebet spear (translated the word by darts) that Joab had just killed Absalom (2 Sam 18:14). 3.

{"palavra":" assir, assur ","texto":" Assur was one of Noah's grandsons (Gen. 10: 11,22), whom the idolatry of recent times had elevated to the position of a god. Assyrians often call their country the land of the god Assur - in early times the empire's capital was Assur (Kileh-Shergat), and it is likely that the name of Assyria derived from this city. Country and people. In ancient geography, Assyria was a country to the east of the Tigris River, bordered to the north by Armenia, east by the Middle, and south by Susiana and Chaldea. The region is crossed by several rivers, the main one being the Tiger (* see Hidéquel). the northern and southern territories were mountainous, though unfit for grazing, but also produced fruit, wheat, and cotton. It was to these mountains that Salmaneser sent as settlers the inhabitants of Ephraim and Galilee, when he seized the ten tribes (2 Kings 17). They are now partly populated by the Nestorians whose ancestors embraced Christianity. The people are plunged into gross and superstitious ignorance. Assur was originally the name, not of a country, but of a city founded in ancient times on the shores of the Tigris - later the surrounding country was named. It was built by a people of a race similar to that of the modern Turks, and was later conquered by the Semitic Assyrians, people linked by blood and language to the Hebrews and Arabs. The name, which originally meant water boundary, was slightly changed by the Assyrians, taking the form of a word that, in Assyria, means graceful. And thus became Assur a divine personification of the power and constitution of Assyria. Assur (Kileh-Sherghat) was not always the capital, but the seat of government was changed to Nineveh, Calla and Dur-Sargin, which today are respectively known by the names Konyurgik, Nimrud, and Khorsabad. Instead of Dur-Sargin, the book of Genesis mentions Resem between Nineveh and Calah (Gen. 10:12). Of these cities is Nineveh at least as old as Assur. Assyria only began to rise when the Babylonian monarchy was already becoming old. Prior to this, the country was named after Guthio (Kurdistan), which has been identified with that of Goim, or nations, referred to in Gen. 14.1, and of which Tidal was king. There seems to have been a time when the princes of Assur were mere governors, appointed by the emperors of Babylon, since the oldest we know of were called themselves viceroys and not kings. The first possessors of this land, generally called Akkadians, were the ones who invented the cuneiform system of writing, and founded the main cities of Babylon, and were also the builders of the oldest known Babylonian monuments. (* see Babylon.) Although the Semitic invaders subdued the people of Acadia, they nevertheless survived for a long time in their language, which, occupying the same place as the Latin in Europe, was generally known to educated Babylonians. the Babylonians were farmers, but the Assyrians were a military and commercial people, simple in their ways but cruel and fierce, impaling and burning alive the inhabitants of the conquered cities. They constituted a truly military power, but destroyed their great fortress of Nineveh, the nation itself became extinct (* see Nineveh). Historical Summary We know little of the first Assyrian chiefs except their names, with Bel-Capcapi being their first king, and no longer viceroy (16th century BC). For some centuries the history of the struggles that the Assyrian people had to endure with Babylon is occupied. Rimom-Hirari i (1320 BC) left inscriptions in which his wars are mentioned. His son founded the city of Calah, and six generations of his descendants sat on the Assyrian throne. Then came Tiglate-Pileser II, founder of the first Assyrian empire, extending its boundaries from Cilicia, to the west, to Kurdistan to the east. When this conqueror reached the Mediterranean Sea, after having subdued the Hittites, he symbolized this conquest of the sea by a ship on which he sailed, killing a dolphin. He beautified Nineveh, and in the year 1130 besieged the city of Babylon, taking it. (* see Tiglath-Pileser.) But the achievements of Tiglath-Pileser were lost in the following reigns, during which the kingdom of David and Solomon arose and widened. However, in the years 911 to 858 BC, the Assyrian empire once again revived, making the journeys of the conquering monarchs remarkable for their horrible barbarities, such as impalements and pyramids of human heads. Assur-Natsirpal's armies invaded Armenia, Mesopotamia, Hindustan, Babylon, Phenicia, while those of Salmaneser II, who subjected Hosea, further stretched the boundaries of the nation, marking the height of Assyrian power. In one of the monuments of this king are traced the figures of the bearers of Jehu son of Omri."},

{"palavra":" astrologer ","texto":" foretelling the future by the aspects, influences, and positions of the heavenly bodies was very much in vogue among the ancient people, except perhaps the Hebrews. The word astrologer is derived from the Greek words aster (star) and logos (speech or word). Although there was a great deal of rogue and quackery among astrologers, especially when they intended to predict future events by observing them (which they supposed to influence men's affairs), they nevertheless passed on to later generations very useful knowledge, and were the founders of modern science of astronomy. The proof that an attempt was made at very remote times to regulate the year, according to the annual movement of the Sun, lies in the fact that the Jewish months are divided into thirty days each (Gen. 7: 11-4: 4). the Egyptians, Babylonians, and Phoenicians manifested great superiority in astronomical science. We are told that there were magicians and enchanters in Egypt (Ex 7:11 - Lev. 19: 31 - 20: 27 - Deut. 18:20), who calculated the eclipses of the Sun and the Moon, and pretended to the people that they had produced these phenomena by their enchantments. Some of the constellations are mentioned in Job (9.9 - 38.31.32) - in is (13.10), in Am (5.8) - and in 2 Kings (23.5). It is not at all surprising that the Hebrews had not paid much attention to astronomy, since the study of astrology, which was given high importance among pagans, was forbidden to them (Lev. 20.27 - Deut 18.10 - is 47.9 - Jr 27.9 - Dn 2.13, 48). In fact, Daniel studied the art of astrology in Babylon, but did not practice it (Dan. 1:20 - 2,2). astrologers (certainly the wizards of chapter 2 of Mt) divided the heavens into rooms or dwellings, assigning to each division a governor or president. This may perhaps explain the origin of the word Beelzebub, or the lord of the heavenly dwellings (Matt. 10: 25-12: 24-27; Mark 3:22; Luke 11: 15-19). (* see Hurt, Wizards.)"},

During his stay, St. Paul gave his memorable speech at the Areopagus before the Athenian philosophers. The sacred historian's remark concerning the inquiring character of the Athenians (Acts 17:21) is justified by many other writers. Demosthenes, the celebrated Athenian speaker, blames his countrymen for this habit of constantly walking around the market, asking each other: What news is there? Their natural liveliness was partly due to the purity and clarity of the atmosphere, which allowed them to spend a great deal of time outdoors. the people, as St. Paul notes, were somewhat superstitious - and in the city, in every direction, were a large number of temples, altars, and other sacred buildings. St. Paul disputed with the Jews in a synagogue of the city (Ac 17:17).

The filthy birds, which could not be used as food, were those that fed on meat, fish and dead animals. Those who fed on insects, grains, and fruit were clean animals. This classification can easily agree with modern ideas on the subject. another clause in Jewish law forbade the mother bird to be removed from the nest, although her young or her eggs could be taken from there. There are several references to bird habits. Jeremiah (8: 7) speaks of the arrival of the stork, the crane, and the swallow - and in Song of Solomon (2:11, 12) the singing of the birds and the voice of the turtledove are heralds of spring. In Ec 12.4 this expression is found, the voice of birds: it is that of the nightingale, which exists in great numbers along the banks of the Jordan and in the vicinity of the Dead Sea. Sings very well, and is a bird that easily domesticates. Such birds are much sought after in the East, and there is a reference to this custom in Job (41: 5): Will you play with him as a bird? The vast majority of birds in Palestine belong to the high-flying bird class. In the lower reaches of the Jordan Valley are subtropical birds not seen in the northernmost regions. In addition to these there are some fifteen species peculiar to Palestine. Birds were widely used as food by the inhabitants of the Holy Land, and still are today. In early times they were mainly caught by means of nets and traps (Ps 124: 7 - 7:23) - but they are now hunted with the rifle on the outskirts of Jerusalem. Another system of hunting birds, especially partridges and bustards, is to throw a small stick. A hunt of this genus is alluded to in 1 Sm 26.20. In one passage Bildad mentions four different methods of catching birds (Job 18: 8-10). Seabirds and waterfowl are rare in Palestine - but birds of prey such as vultures, azores, etc., are numerous, and there are many references to them in the Bible. In the book of Deuteronomy (32:11) it is said that God taught Israel as the eagle teaches children. (* see Eagle.)"},

When does this happen? When God decides to let an awakening happen on a small scale within the life of one person. Revival means in the first place that warm, weary believers awaken to a new spiritual life and come back into contact with \"rivers of living water.\" Or expressing it with a biblical passage: \"... your life is hidden with Christ in God\" (Col. 3.3). This is almost always the beginning of a revival. But we always think of spectacular events when we talk about rivers of living water and awakening.

When King Uzziah intended to burn incense on the altar of the temple, Azariah strongly resisted him, accompanied by eighty priests of the Lord. Uzziah was therefore attacked with leprosy. Azariah was contemporary of Isaiah, Amos and Joel. 4. High priest in the days of Hezekiah (2 Chron. 31: 10-13). He was especially concerned with supplying the chambers of the temple, storing there tithes, offerings, and consecrated objects for the use of priests and Levites. The maintenance of these things and the maintenance of the cult depended entirely on these offerings, and when the people were not careful at this point, the priests and Levites were forced to go to their lands, leaving the house of God deserted (Neh. 10:35 to 39). - 12.27 to 30.44.47). 5.

There was trade in olive oil with the Tire dealers, who probably exported it to Egypt, where olive trees, for the most part, do not produce it of good quality.

The meal offering, prescribed by the Law, was often mixed with olive oil (Lev. 2: 7, 15, 8: 26-31 - Num. 7: 19- Deut. 12: 17-32: 13- 1 Kgs. 5:12, 15- 1 Chr. 12:40 - Ez. 16:13, 19). the oil was included among the first fruit offerings (Ex 22: 29-23: 16 - Num. 18: 12 - Deut 18: 4 - 2 Chronicles 31: 5) - and his tithing was claimed (Deut. 12: 17 - 2 Chronicles 31: 5 - Ne 10: 37,39 - 13,12 - Ez 45:14 ). the oil for the light was to be, by express order, the oil of the olives crushed in the winepress (Ex 25: 6 - 27: 20,21 - 35: 8) Lev 24.2 - 1 Sm3.3 - 2 Chr 13.11 - Zech 4.3,12). The oil was used in the consecration of the priests (Ex 29.2,23 - Lev 6,15,21), in the daily sacrifice (Ex 29:40), the purification of the leper (Lev 14,10 to 18,21,24,28), and complement of the Nazarite vow (Num. 6:15). Certain offerings were to be made without that oil, such as those made for atonement for sin (Lev. 5:11) and because of jealousy (Num. 5:15). Jews also used oil to rub the body after bathing or before a festive occasion, but in time of mourning or some calamity they abstained from using it. At the banquets of the Egyptians there was the custom of anointing the guests - the servants anointed each other's heads as they took their place at the table (Deut 28:40 - Rt 3.3 - 2 Sm 12.20 - 14.2 - Ps 23.5 - 92.10 - 104. 15 - Is S1.3 - Dn 10.3 - Am 6.6 - Mq 6.15 - Lc 7.46). Olive oil was also applied externally or internally as a medicine (1: 6 - Mk 6: 13 - Lk 10: 34 - James 5:14). He was usually employed in the lamps, which in Egypt have a glass reservoir where water is first poured: the wick is made of cotton, twisted around a straw (Matt. 25: 1-8 - Luke 12:35). the oil indicated joy, while lack betrayed sadness or humiliation (Is 61.3 - Jl 2.19 - Rev 6.6). Often olive oil is symbolically taken for nourishment and comfort (Deut 32.13 - 33.24 - Job 29.6 - Ps 45.7 - 109.18 - is 61.3). (* see Anointing, olive tree.)"},

This name, in its origin, meant lord, or possessor, but was later employed to show man's relationship to his wife, or divinity to his worshiper. It was never strictly a proper name, but it was the name of the god of each place, like Baal-Peor (Num. 25: 3). And its plural was Baalim. Compare the personal names, such as Hasdrubal, and Baal-Hanan. In the high places was Baal worshiped as the male principle, which gave addition to the flocks and production to the earth. the ritual acts were performed with much pomp and ceremonies, with offerings of nature's products and incense, burnt offerings and human sacrifices (2: 8 - Jer. 19: 5). their priests were sometimes so excited that they were wounded with knives, as did other pagan priests, mentioned by Herodotus and Plutarch (1 Kings 18:28). Baal worship had spread over a large area, and had existed since early times (Num. 22:41). It predominated among the Canaanites and Moabites, passing from these to the people of Israel. By Ahab's marriage to Jezebel the Phoenician cult of Baal became the state religion among the Israelites until it was uprooted in the reign of Jehu. Baal worship never completely obliterated the worship of the Lord. For a time the two religions were followed side by side - and later the Lord became the Baal or Lord of Canaan, being worshiped with the heinous rites of the pagan god. And so it came to pass, as has been said, that the Israelites linked the name of Baal with their own names, as they did with the name of the Lord in words like isaiah (is-Baal, is-Bosete). the Lord's prophets have always fought this degrading and cruel cult with all their might. Elijah courageously and successfully raised national awareness against the practice of demoralizing religion (1 Kgs 18). Hosea also condemned it as a true idolatry, and Jehu attacked with great rigor this Baal cult introduced by Ahab, but failed to suppress it entirely, because Josiah was later compelled to employ violent measures to avoid his revival among the chosen people, who had erected temples to the false god, and set their images and altars everywhere, supporting their priests (2 Kings 23: 4, 5). False worship was practiced in the high places (1 Kings 18:20) or even on the terraces of the houses (Jer 32:29). So widespread was the worship of Baal that evidence of this religion is found in many countries, that is, Babylon (Bel), and the Phoenician colonies of the Mediterranean."},

{"palavra":" Babylon (city of) ","texto":" The modern Hil-lah (Babel). The Greek form of the Hebrew Babel. Babylon was the capital of the Chaldean kingdom of Babylon. Although it was not the oldest city in the empire, it became over time the most important for its grandeur and influence. Situated on the banks of the Euphrates, almost 80 km. south of modern Baghdad, in the midst of fertile plains, near the Persian Gulf, was the city of Babylon the center of the ancient world trade. Although the date of its foundation is uncertain, however, its connection with Acade and Caln (Gen. 10: 10) suggests a great antiquity, at least 3,000 years BC. The history of Babylon is a long series of struggles sustained by various governors and military commanders. to possess and conserve. It was often besieged, its temples and walls were often razed, its inhabitants cruelly killed, and stripped of its treasures; but, marvelously, this most opulent and magnificent city always rises from ever more beautiful dust until, in Nebuchadnezzar's day, it is one of the wonders of the world, with huge buildings and a larger population than probably any other city. from ancient times, being cut in all directions by navigable channels. The present ruins, all that remains of the great city of Babylon, are a large number of forts stretching a distance of eight kilometers from north to south, especially on the left bank of the river. There are remains of walls, temples and royal palaces everywhere. the northernmost fort has generally been identified with the Tower of Babel, still standing 19.5 meters high. Larger than this is the palace platform series. The remains of fortifications are numerous, and on the banks of the Euphrates the remains of large dikes can still be seen today. It was Nebuchadnezzar who ordered the river to be turned aside, and the bricks to be laid over the city. The city was described by Herodotus and other writers who could see it. And though their descriptions differ somewhat, yet they all agree in their marvelous grandeur and magnificence. The city was built on both sides of the river, surrounded by a double defensive wall. According to the measurement of Herodotus, these walls, with 90 km. in circumference, they enclosed an area of ​​322 square kilometers. Nine tenths of this area was occupied with gardens, parks, and fields, while the people lived in two-, three-, and four-story houses."},
{"palavra":" Babylon (empire of) ","texto":" The importance to the Bible student of what was the empire of Babylon can be seen from the fact that there are about three hundred references in the Holy Scriptures to the country and its people. In the Old Testament the Hebrew word Babel can mean both empire and city, although sometimes the name Sinear is used to define the whole country. In fact, Sinear was the oldest name of that great territory (Gen. 10: 10 and 11: 2). In the Scriptures of later times, after the exile, this region was called Chaldea, or the land of the Chaldeans (Jer 21: 4 and Ezek 12:13). the Babylonians had no name for their country as a whole, but spoke of Acade or Sumer, when they wanted to refer to the northern or southern parts. They had been named after the previous inhabitants. Physical description. Babylon is a plain of 650 km. in length about 160 km. width. It is bordered to the south by the Persian Gulf, and to the west by the Arabian Desert. To the east was the Tigris River, and to the north Assyria; but this northern boundary has often been changed according to the greater or lesser magnitude of the Assyrian nation. Due to a wise irrigation system through a canal network, the fields of Babylon were remarkably fertile. And the fertility was such that the wheat itself grew without the help of the farmer, and every year on the cultivated land two and three times the harvest. And then there were pastures in abundance. To the great harvests of grain and dates must be added the large number of horses, camels, oxen, rams, and goats that the Babylonians had. There were a lot of birds of many species, and the rivers were full of fish. One can see today, in the sad conditions of that once very fertile land, how the prophecies of Scripture were fulfilled. Today it is a desert with marshes, populated by hyenas, bobcats, panthers and wild boars. its great temples and cities, once home to mighty conquerors, are now heaps of rubble. How amazing was the fall of Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms (Is 13:19)! There are no inhabitants today except for some wandering tribes of Bedouin (Is 14.Z2). Babylon was the wilderness of which the prophet Isaiah speaks (Isa 21: 1); and the words of Jeremiah dwelling upon many waters (Jer 51:13) were alluding to the overflow of the Euphrates, as well as to the numerous open channels to divert the flood waters elsewhere and also to carry goods. These were the rivers of Babylon, by which the children of Israel sat and wept (Ps. 137: 1). It was the Babylonian capital a land of merchants; city ​​of merchants (Eze 17.4). the kingdom was one of the four thrones described by Daniel, and is enhanced by the symbol of an eagle-winged lion. In addition to the city of Babylon, others had to be considered. And of these, one of the most important was Eridu (the modern Abu-Sahrein). This port was in the Persian Gulf, which in those days stretched farther north than today, at a distance of 210 km. This is due to the amount of land and wreckage carried by the waters of the Euphrates. Slightly to the west of this Abu-Sahrein settlement is a barrier marking the place of Ur, which is invariably referred to in the Bible by the name of Ur of the Chaldeans (Gen. 11.28). In early times, not after the reign of Gudea, which in their western conquest went to Palestine, the kings of Ur had supreme rule over Babylon. One of the kings of Ur, named Ur-gur, was very jealous of religion, so he had temples built in most cities of Babylon. His son, Dungi (circa 2600 BC), known by the name of king of the four quarters, was also an enthusiastic temple builder, as can be seen from the inscriptions on the blades in the British Museum. It was Dungi who erected a temple to the god Nergal in Cuta, the modern Tell-ibrahim (2 Kings 17:24), a settlement near Babylon, and was inhabited by a warrior tribe from Persia, which was eventually subdued by Alexander the Great. For a time Ur lost its importance while the kings of Isin upheld their dominion over Babylon; but soon we find it retaining its former supremacy over all Babylon. However, the most important city of the Babylonian empire was to the north. Retaining its independence character during the second dynasty of Ur, the city of Babylon gradually reached an importance that lasted for nearly two thousand years. After Ur was decaying, Babel gradually assumed a dominant position in the Land of the Chaldeans, Hamurabi or Anrafel (Gen. 14) by that time (about 2000 BC) the best known of his kings. Already in the year 1700 BC was that city the seat of the government. the Babylonians were small in stature, thick-bodied, with a Jewish nose, broad lips, and slanting eyes. her hair was black, thick and curly."},

At the desert cleansing ceremony (Ex 24: 6,8), Moses received half the blood of the sacrifices in basins, and sprinkled with him the people. Footwashing bowls were wider and deeper than those used to contain food - and were often made of wood (Jn 13.5). Certain wooden bowls were used for meals, for liquids, and for broth, as is done today, among the Arabs (2 Kgs. 4:40). Perhaps Joseph's cup for divination was of this kind (Gen. 44: 5). These bowls were filled with liquid, which from a swallow was drunk as a preservative against evil. (* see pottery.) 2. The basin of the tabernacle was set between the door and the altar - it was made of glossy metal that had mirrored the women (Ex 38: 8). In the temple of Solomon there were ten basins of yellow metal (1 Kings 7: 27-39), each having a capacity of one thousand three hundred and fifty liters. They were used to wash the animals offered in the burnt offerings (2 Chron 4.6). In Ephesians 5:26 and Titus 3.5 it should probably be said to be a washbasin, the metaphor being applied to baptism."},

Though living among the heathen, Balaam had some knowledge of the true God, and was a man of great intelligence, with a reputation for holiness and wisdom. He was considered a prophet among his people, who, according to the ideas of many other ancient nations, had a curious habit of turning enemies over to the destroying gods before entering into combat with him. Balaam had dealt with his special gifts, as shown by the fact that Balak's messengers had brought with them gifts to reward the prophet for his enchantments when they came to him at the king's request. the Israelites had begun their conquests in the Holy Land, and so the king of Moab, with the Midianites, his allies, sought by all means to halt their advance. However, God-warned Balaam refused, though desirous of his profit (2 Pet. 2:15), to carry out what the king desired - and only after he had gone to his house did another major deputation decide to leave. But this was against the will of God, who somehow made Balaam understand his bad step by the ass's mouth. The result was then seen. We are not, however, led to believe that he became a true believer in the Lord, because later we will find him vainly using every effort to bring about the destruction of the Israelites (Num. 25). And he died when he fought for the Midianites against those whom he had thought to curse (Num. 31: 8, 16)."},

To obtain the balsam, cut the tree, always a 4-meter-tall green plant, or strike it with an ax, placing a cup or a hanging bottle underneath the cut, which receives the sap from the tree. as she transudes. The amount harvested from each tree is very small. In ancient times this fragrant balm was famous throughout the known world, and even then it was so scarce that small samples of it were considered a great treasure, and brought to Rome as a trophy when Palestine was conquered. Gilead balm was so named because it was the balsamic resin exported mainly from the Gilead ramps. Its production was, in fact, almost private in that region. It was very precious, being twice its weight in gold, and constituting a high trade item because of its therapeutic qualities when applied to open wounds or sores. Interestingly, the original roots of the balsam bush were brought to Palestine by the Queen of Sheba. But this cannot be easily believed, since the balm was exported from Gilead to Egypt as early as patriarchal times (Gen. 43.11), when Jacob considered it a beautiful gift for his ignored son. In the nearly tropical Jordan valley the shrub grew everywhere in the days near the coming of Christ.
